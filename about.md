![My Portrait]({{ site.url }}/assets/glacier_profile.jpg)

Hello. My name is Jessica Strein and I am a data analyst, bioinformatician, and developer. I discovered a passion for computers during graduate school, when my research required me to quickly learn Python and R in order to analyze my data. I love learning new languages and techniques for solving problems with data, and I am very excited about using this knowledge to create a better world. I am currently volunteering with [Defenders of Wildlife](www.defenders.org), a non-profit organization dedicated to improve support for endangered wildlife in the United States.

While I spend most of my time staring at my computer, I also love getting outside and exploring nature.
