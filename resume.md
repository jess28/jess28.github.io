# Work Experience #
_2015 - Present_

__Defenders of Wildlife - Data analysis and visualization volunteer__

* Created the initial version of a dynamic web application to allow users to explore federal and state expenditures on endangered species across years, states, counties, and taxonomic groups
* Working with a team that is building a platform to crowdsource open-source images of threatened and endangered plants and animals
* Integrating UI with database operations in a way that will scale under heavy loads,using concurrency to allow multiple edits to a database simultaneously
* Using both R Shiny and Go in web development and database connections

_2013 - 2015_

__University of Connecticut - Graduate Researcher__

* Identified previously unknown sex-specific copy number variants, and confirmed known CNVs, in the _Drosophila melanogaster_ genome using computational tools. Identifying CNVs is important because they are linked to many cancers and computational identification can speed discovery.
* Learned how to write code in Python, R, SQL, Javascript, HTML/CSS, and Bash
* Used remote servers and supercomputers to accomplish computationally intensive tasks
* Assisted both novice and experienced programmers in the lab with programming issues and questions

_2014_

__Mentor Connection - University of Connecticut Site Mentor__

* Guided high school students through creating a website that allowed users to identify frog orthologs of human disease-associated genes. This resource showed how useful a frog model can be in human disease research.
* Taught the students how to develop a UI using HTML/CSS and Javascript

_2011 - 2013_

__Central Connecticut State University - Undergraduate Researcher__

* Responsible for creating assays to test the ability of previously recovered bacteria to remediate gasoline contaminated soils through metabolizing the gasoline
* Worked in a team of seven other scientists, including chemists, to put individual experiments into one cohesive project

_2010 - 2011_

__Central Connecticut State University - Undergraduate Researcher__

* Investigated interactions between _Propionibacterium acnes_, a bacteria that causes human acne, and several bacteriophage to analyze the phages' ability to kill this bacteria in a lab environment
* Developed an assay to improve the concentration of phage from the original container for use in identification
* Worked in a pair to improve speed at collecting results
