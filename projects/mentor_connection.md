<h1 class="page-heading">MENTOR CONNECTION</h1>

I was the programming lead for two high school students for the [Uconn Mentor Connection](http://mentor.education.uconn.edu/) in the summer of 2014. This program brings high school students in their last two years into projects and research guided by university professors or graduate students. This allows the high school students to learn more about what it would be like to work in their chosen profession and get valuable experience in their potential field.

Our project was to create a website that would allow users to search a database for a human disease or gene and find the frog analogue (or vice versa). This website would show researchers how useful the frog model organism can be, even above the usual mouse model.
