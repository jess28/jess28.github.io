<h1 class="page-heading">AN EXPLORATION OF COPY NUMBER VARIATION BETWEEN THE SEXES</h1>
<h1 class="page-heading"><em>Drosophila melanogaster</em></h1>

I began learning programming because of my [Master's degree thesis](https://zenodo.org/record/48371). I needed to analyze data sets that were hundreds of gigabytes in size, so Excel was not going to be enough. My first language was Python, and I used it to begin manipulating the genomic data I had. I also used R for the statistical analysis and all the visualizations, and Bash scripts for automation and quick command line operations.

The first step in beginning my analysis was to combine the many sequenced fly genomes I had into one male and one female mass genome.

Languages used: Python, R, Bash/Linux scripting
