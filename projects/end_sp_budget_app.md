<h1 class="page-heading">ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT EXPENDITURES APP</h1>
<h1 class="page-heading">Defenders of Wildlife</h1>

One thing that Defenders of Wildlife wants to showcase in their policy advocating is how the money is being used for endangered species recovery. I helped create a web app that shows the way money is being allocated across species, states, years, and funding sources.

Since this was creating using [R Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/), all of the charts and maps are interactive. The user can narrow the selection of variables used to get different views for the data provided.

If you are interested in seeing more, you can request access to the closed app at the Defenders of Wildlife [Development Page](https://defend-esc-dev.org/).
