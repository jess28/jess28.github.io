<h1 class="page-heading">ENDANGERED SPECIES IMAGES APP</h1>
<h1 class="page-heading">Defenders of Wildlife</h1>

Part of Defenders of Wildlife's mission is to raise awareness for endangered species in the general public. There are relatively few "well-known" endangered species, so it is important to raise awareness for the ones ignored. The best way to get someone's attention is through images, so I created a web app to collect pictures of endangered species submitted by users and store them in a collective database. This database was also searchable, so that anyone can use the collected images.

If you are interested in seeing more, you can request access to the closed app at the Defenders of Wildlife [Development Page](https://defend-esc-dev.org/).
